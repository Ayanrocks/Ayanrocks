<p>I'm a 25 year old developer from City of Joy, Kolkata &#128513;. I'm passionate about code and creating something to help make millions of users lives more easy. Some of my languanges in my stack include (JS + Golang) and my Stack will include (Mern + Mevn + Pern + GraphQL). I use C++ as my hobby and will learn Rust some time in the future</p>
